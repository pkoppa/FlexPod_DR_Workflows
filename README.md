## FlexPod_DR_Workflows
#### Intersight Cloud Orchestrator enables you to export workflows from a Intersight account to your system and then import them to another account. 
#### We have created  few sample workflows (Sample JSON files for Configuring FlexPod Storage, Creating Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Configuring SnapMirror etc) by exporting the built workflow which can be imported to your account. 


### Developing the workflow, input it takes and output are detailed in the CVD: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/UCS_CVDs/flexpod_cvo_ico_ntap.html
