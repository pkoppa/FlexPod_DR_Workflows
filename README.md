## FlexPod_DR_Workflows
#### Intersight Cloud Orchestrator enables you to export workflows from a Intersight account to your system and then import them to another account. 
#### We have created  few sample workflows (Few sample JSON files for Configuring FlexPod Storage, Creating Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Configuring SnapMirror etc) by exporting the built workflow which can be imported to your account.
